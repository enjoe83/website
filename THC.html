<h2>What is RSO (Rick Simpson Oil) and What are the benefits?</h2>
  <p>What is Rick Simpson oil?
    Rick Simpson oil (RSO) is a cannabis oil product. It was created by Rick Simpson, a Canadian medical marijuana activist.
    RSO differs from a lot of other cannabis oils because it contains higher levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This is the main psychoactive cannabinoid in marijuana that gets people “high.” Other therapeutic cannabis oils tend to contain a cannabinoid called cannabidiol (CBD) and little or no THC. In addition, Rick Simpson doesn’t sell RSO. Instead, he encourages to people to create their own using his methods.<br>
 </p>
 <p>What are the potential benefits?
  The main claim surrounding RSO is that it treats cancer. After Simpson was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2003, he began applying RSO to the cancerous spots on his face and neck. According to Simpson, the spots healed within a few days.
  According to Rick Simpson’s website, RSO is made from a particular type of cannabis called Cannabis indica, which produces a sedative effect that helps the body heal.
  In addition to cancer, RSO is said to also treat:
  </p>
<ol>
  <li>multiple sclerosis</li>
  <li>arthritis</li>
  <li>asthma</li>
  <li>infections</li>
  <li>inflammation</li>
  <li>high blood pressure</li>
  <li>depression</li>
  <li>insomnia</li>
</ol><br>
<p>The bottom line
While there’s some promising research surrounding the use of cannabis to treat cancer, experts are still a long way from having conclusive evidence about which cannabinoids and strains work best. In addition, some research suggests that THC can actually increase the growth of cancer cells. Large human studies are needed before cannabis becomes a recommended cancer treatment. If you’re interested in using cannabis for cancer or to treat the side effects of conventional treatments, talk to your doctor.
