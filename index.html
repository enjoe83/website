  <h1>Tupa's Joint</h1>
  <h2>Cannabis Dispensary in Vernon B.C</h2>
  <p>Tupa’s Joint is owned by Okanagan Nation member Cory Brewer. The name Tupa in the Nsyilxcen language is one way to say “great grandmother,” Brewer says. “The reason we chose the name ‘Tupa’s Joint’ is because we believe in the power of our Tupas, their healing ways and the strength that makes them who they are,” he explains.</p>
