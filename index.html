  <h2>Cannabis Dispensary in Vernon B.C</h2>
  <p><em>Tupa’s Joint</em> is owned by Okanagan Nation member Cory Brewer. The name Tupa in the Nsyilxcen language is one way to say “great grandmother,” Brewer says. “The reason we chose the name ‘Tupa’s Joint’ is because we believe in the power of our Tupas, their healing ways and the strength that makes them who they are,” he explains.</p>

<h1>What is CBD?</h1>
  <p>CBD, also known as Cannabidiol, is a natural compand found in cannabis. Cannabis contains 113 different cannabinoids; the most notable ones are THC and CBD. THC and CBD share a nearly exact formula, but one critical difference in their molecular structure gives each compand unique medicinal properies. For instance, unlike THC, CBD isn't psychoactive and won't make you high. Instead when ingestted, CBD not only combats the psychoactive effects of THC, but also relieves pain, reducing inflammation and beyond.</p>

  <p>Studies indicate that CBD binds to CB1, one of your brain's endocannabinoid receptors, at a different spot fromwhere other cannabinoids normally bind to the receptor. The process, called allosteric modulation, leaves the binding site free, but changes the shape of the receptor so that it has a weaker binding affinty-rendering it less responsive.</p>
  <p>Although decreasing your body's endocannabinoid response might seem counterintuitive, many disruptions to the endocannabinoid system actually stem from an overactive system. If you body struggles with the burden of constant anxiety, or excess weight, then your recpetors are probably being overstimulated, and CBD could give your endocannabinoid system the beak it needs.</p>
